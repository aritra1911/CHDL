# Chip-based Hardware Definition Language
Do you enjoy electronics as a hobby? Do you feel lazy to solder together a circuit on a perfboard? Are you too lazy to
walk to your local electronics store and get the ICs? Do you not trust the ICs provided as there are quite a number of
counterfeits out there? Does your local electronics store not have the ICs you need? Are you a C++ programmer as well,
and are too lazy to learn Verilog or VHDL?

Well, then you are in luck!

## Features
- [x] Model your own chips
- [x] Power them yourself
- [x] Hook wires of specific voltage or logic levels
- [x] Do whatever you want with the outputs
- [ ] Access your favorite 7400 series logic chips from the vast library

## Use
Yeah go ahead, the chips are yours! Don't like them? Model your own! Connect them together, use it as a logic simulator!
You don't have to worry about the decoupling capacitors for your chips, we got you. Our Power Supplies have absolutely
no ripple whatsoever! You turn a gate on and the voltage level doesn't drop at all!

> This is a joke in case you couldn't tell, learn Verilog, or VHDL if you're serious. You can clearly see that I'm not.

## Contribute
We'd love to see the chips you've made! We'd love to use them! They're not just your chips, they're ours! Found a bug?
Well it's very weird that you did, because this is considered one of our flawless works! Anyway if you find bug(s), file
an issue, or fix them yorself! Don't forget to send a PR, that's how Open Source works!
